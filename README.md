# NumPy Tasks Repository

This repository contains a collection of **NumPy-based tasks and exercises** designed to showcase proficiency in **array operations, numerical computing, and efficient data handling** using Python's NumPy library. These tasks serve as examples, but NumPy can also be used to solve more complex problems such as **linear algebra, eigenvalue computations, optimization problems, and large-scale numerical simulations**.

### 📌 **Files Overview**

- **Task 1.py** → Converts a NumPy array of strings into a fixed-length string type and checks character preservation.
- **Task 2.py** → Generates a random array and counts values below 0.025 or above 0.975.
- **Task 3.py** → Extracts the last 20 elements of an array and adds 40, solving the problem in two different ways.
- **Task 4.py** → Creates and reshapes stacked zero and one arrays into a 3D structure while using array indexing.
- **Task 5.py** → Splits a dataset into training, validation, and test sets and saves them as CSV files.
- **Task 6.py** → Computes the dot product of two matrices by reshaping them when necessary, avoiding loops.
